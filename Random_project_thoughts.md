when memory system is operational, we could expand with voice
F.ex RVC v2, a retrieval-Based Voice Conversion v2 is a system that lets you:
- Clone a voice using ~10 minutes of audio
- Convert any input voice (even TTS or your own) into that voice
- Use it for roleplay AIs, assistants, or emotional avatars

Further: if journalling on an ipad (for example using goodnotes or notability or similar) we could also implement an OCR to convert the notes to textfiles and implement this in LLM traning
personal goal: create one LLM that works as a shrink, one LLM that works as a personal trainer and one for roleplay
question is whether the different personas should be able to access notes across. for example if I miss workouts for a while, the shrink should be able to pick up on that.
current thought: tagging notes so the LLMs can access notes if they are tagged.

example:
"01.01.2025 - Journal entry
Today I skipped jogging because it was raining"  
tags: workout, shrink

"02.01.2025 - Journal entry
I felt lonely today"
tags: shrink, roleplay

etc.
