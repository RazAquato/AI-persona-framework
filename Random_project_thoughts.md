when memory system is operational, we could expand with voice
F.ex RVC v2, a retrieval-Based Voice Conversion v2 is a system that lets you:
- Clone a voice using ~10 minutes of audio
- Convert any input voice (even TTS or your own) into that voice
- Use it for roleplay AIs, assistants, or emotional avatars
